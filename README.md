# quant-prep

Inspired by [@Aniruddha-Deb](https://github.com/Aniruddha-Deb/quant-prep) (who was in turn, inspired by [Jerry Qin](https://jerryqin.com)), I decided to log my quant preparation as well! I thought that keeping a log of what I've accomplished / done to prepare should be helpful.

## Books
1. **Stat110 Handbook** - Thank you to Prof. Blitz for this amazing class and textbook!
3. **[Jane Street's Probability and Markets Guide](https://www.janestreet.com/probability-markets/)** - skimmed the first part + some practice questions, mostly read for market making
4. **[Flash Crash: A Trading Savant, a Global Manhunt, and the Most Mysterious Market Crash in History](https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Crash-Trading-Manhunt-Mysterious/dp/0385543654))** - About the flash crash of 2010, honestly started for pleasure-reading, really interesting so far --  *In Progress*
5. **Akuna Options 101 Course** - Part 1 Complete -- *In Progress*
2. **Xinfeng Zhou** - Quant Finance Interviews, aka the green book! This book is awesome.

The brainteasers reminded me of the proofs I did in *CS20: Discrete Mathmatics for CS* and *Stat110* helped me prep for the probability section. *Stat131: Time Series and Prediction* covered time series modeling for financial data (e.g., martingale difference -- see my final project for this class in a seperate repo). *CS50* helped me get an early (but general and less in-depth) grasp of the algorithms part. Overall, invaluable resource.


Books from the OG page -- things I want to run through but haven't yet:
1. **Heard on the street** - looked like Cracking the Coding Interview but for quant
3. **50 problems in Probability** 
4. **Mark Joshi** 
6. **[Quantitative Primer](https://github.com/dwcoder/QuantitativePrimer/tree/master)** - Looks like a very good resource, but it wasn't doing the rounds when I interviewed, so I got to know about this recently.

## Mental Math

1. [Zetamac](https://arithmetic.zetamac.com) - baseline of 33, peak of 45 on default settings as of 07/30

*Note, I used the chrome extension [My Zetamac Stats](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/icfkboadjakpikgeijimiegeebfpfgji?utm_source=item-share-cb) to keep track of my progress*


## Videos 
1. [Peak Algo Trading Full Course | Commodity Market Futures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=payanJI-4wxdODMI&v=rrbahhoePN4&feature=youtu.be)
* Really solid video -- this was the first video I watched directly about high frequency trading.
3. [What is Quantitative Finance? ðŸ“ˆ Intro for Aspiring Quants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVtUcM1sWQw)
* this had a really cool representation of using multidimensional graphs to compare stocks. Additionally the connection between having a portfolio of stocks to the mulitvariate normal distribution really resonated with me 

  
# Notes from the OG account:

3. [RankYourBrain](https://rankyourbrain.com/mental-math/) - has fractions/decimals, but I don't like the UI
4. [RFQJobs](https://rfqjobs.com/practice/math/) - Really liked the Optiver test here and the Focus-Fractions and Focus-Decimals
5. [tradinginterview](https://www.tradinginterview.com/courses/mental-arithmetic/quizzes/quiz-hard-arithmetic/) Hard - ~~This is probably the closest to the optiver test from what I can make out: sequential flow, +/-1 marking, and questions of the same format and same level~~ **EDIT**: The TradingInterview website changed since the last time I took the test, and the hard test moved [here](https://www.tradinginterview.com/courses/mental-arithmetic/quizzes/preset-hard-arithmetic/). This is a bit harder than the actual Optiver test I faced, which had MCQs. Fortunately, they updated their website with a more up-to-date version, which can be found [here](https://www.tradinginterview.com/courses/mental-arithmetic/quizzes/optiver-math-test/)
6. [TraderMaths](https://www.tradermaths.com/math-tests) hard - decent, but again, UI is off what I should expect (ability to skim through questions makes it very easy to cherry pick easy ones to maximize score), so I don't do this much
7. [Matiks](https://www.matiks.in/) - gave it a try after spotting it on LinkedIn. QuizUp (RIP) meets mental math. Quite fun, but not too many people yet (will change as more people get on it). My gut feel is most guests are bots/replays, but the experience is not bad and this is a decent substitute for the lack of people on the platform right now. Maybe not super relevant to trading per se, didn't see many division/big multiplication problems but the competition dopamine makes up for it.

## More Puzzles/Problems (Courtesy of OG)

1. **[Brainstellar](https://brainstellar.com)** - good puzzles, but the hard ones are not so hard, and they finish up rather quickly.
2. **[quantguide.io](http://quantguide.io/)** - looks like a newer and better brainstellar. Leetcode for quant. Problems organized by company. However, make sure to give as much decimal precision, or enter your answer as a fraction if it doesn't get accepted (eg [This is a question](https://www.quantguide.io/questions/car-question-i) which doesn't take decimal answers)
3. **[Sarah Chieng's blog](https://milksandmatcha.notion.site/Free-Trading-Resources-v2-4456ae906000487181f3486dbd0dd631)** - Spied recently on twitter, has some amazing stuff.
4. **[Jane Street's Puzzles](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/archive/index.html)** - If anything, these are a level above what I think will be asked on the interview. Absolutely a pleasure to sink your teeth into: need both deep insight and flexible thinking to solve. Some of the relevant ones are
    * [Robot Tug-of-war](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/robot-tug-of-war-index/)
    * [Andy's Morning Stroll](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/current-puzzle/)

5. [Twenty Probability Problems](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~gravner/MAT135A/resources/chpr.pdf)
6. [Dice problems](https://www.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~nagy/NMSA202/dice1.pdf) (shows you how simple questions need not have simple answers)
7. [Evan Chen's Probability Handout](https://web.evanchen.cc/handouts/ProbabilisticMethod/ProbabilisticMethod.pdf)
8. [AoPS Intermediate Probability Problems](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Category:Intermediate_Probability_Problems) - Mostly from AIME/Other olympiads
9. [Putnam Probability questions](http://www.math.utoronto.ca/barbeau/putnamprob.pdf) - ft. the [Infamous 1992 A-6 Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkmNXy7er84&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown)
10. [Jerry Qin's List of Probability Questions](https://jerryqin.com/) - as previously mentioned
11. [Sums and Expcted Value](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/62690) by Errichto: has some nice problems
12. The random Wall Street Oasis/QuantNet threads on these questions - [here](https://quantnet.com/threads/big-list-of-quant-interview-questions-with-answers.36240/), [here](https://quantnet.com/threads/jane-street-interview-questions.3039/), [here](https://quantnet.com/threads/jane-street-capital-second-round-interview.12565/), [here](https://quantnet.com/threads/compilation-of-jane-street-interview-questions.17941/), [here](https://quantnet.com/threads/jane-street-interview-question-needing-help.7591/), [here](https://www.glassdoor.co.in/Interview/Jane-Street-Hong-Kong-Interview-Questions-EI_IE255549.0,11_IL.12,21_IC2308631.htm) - One Glassdoor reviewer said that you should _Forget about the green book - only do dice and card problems and scrape the whole glassdoor_ for Jane Street.
13. Some questions [here](http://williamdemeo.github.io/2014/03/19/probability-quiz/) and [here](https://github.com/ptmminh/quanttest) (very similar questions in both though, doing one thoroughly should be sufficient)
14. [Quant Interview Prep](https://www.math.lsu.edu/~smolinsk/Quant_Interview_Prep.pdf) handout by Aaron Cao
15. [Glassdoor Quant Compilation](https://www.glassdoor.co.in/Interview/quant-interview-questions-SRCH_KO0,5_IP2.htm) (got this from the handout above - very handy)

## Other things

A (non-exhaustive) list of very common problems to be familiar with:
* Monty Hall

*Planning to use the Monty Hall Stat110 review session in which the TFs went over a multitude of spins on the classic MH problem*

* Tying ends of Noodles together, expected value
* Random Walks
* finding Expected first return time in Markov Chain (esp when No stationary distrib exists)
* Prisoner number in drawer ([Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSNsgj1OCLA&ab_channel=Veritasium))
* Prisoners, Hats and umpteen variations
* Birthday Problems
* Three Drawer Paradox (and variations - tie, two envelope, etc)

That's about it, I guess.

## Hindsight
The original creater of this guide ended up as an Optiver SWE intern and posted a blog about her recruiting process [here](https://aniruddhadeb.com/articles/2022/intern-inferno/)
